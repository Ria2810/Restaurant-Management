## System Description:

The main objective of this project is to develop a client/server model. The system has two parts first for the customers and the other for the management side. The customer side allows the customer to view menu list according to their desires and order meal , and at the management side the staff is allowed to edit information regarding menu list, price, billing, etc.
The advantage of the program is that there is no need to hire a person for the same only a system is required to execute it. The customer can work  on the program and select the items which he/she wants to order and accordingly can delete the items if required .It is user friendly, as it works as a calculator, a user can simply add or delete some item if required and accordingly a new bill will be generated.
In short, the program is easily executable and can be easily accessed by a user. It is a great software for the future generation as it saves time and decrease the work of the owner of the restaurant and the waiter too. It will help the owners to handle their customers in a better and a comfortable way.
Requirements definition and management is recognized as a necessary step in the delivery of successful system and software projects, discipline is also required by standards , regulations, and quality improvement initiatives. Creating and managing requirements is a challenge of IT, systems and product development projects or indeed for any activity where you have to manage a contractual relationship. Organization need to effectively define and manage requirements to ensure they are meeting needs of the customer.
